# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview  
This project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease using a machine learning model. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes key health parameters to make predictions. The best-performing algorithm is determined based on accuracy metrics.

## Features  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implemented and compared multiple algorithms to find the most accurate model.  
- **Algorithms Used:**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Random Forest  
- **Performance Analysis:** Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy among the tested algorithms.  

## Technologies and Tools  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
